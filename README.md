# Goniaa Fashion - Luxury Minimalist Fashion App

Goniaa Fashion is a comprehensive, production-ready software suite designed for a luxury minimalist fashion brand. This project provides a unified ecosystem consisting of a robust backend API, a modern web application with an integrated admin dashboard, and a high-performance mobile application.

## Project Architecture

The project is organized into three primary modules, each serving a specific role in the ecosystem:

*   **Web Application (`web/`):** A Next.js application that serves both as the customer-facing storefront and the administrative control panel for managing inventory and orders.
*   **Mobile Application (`mobile/`):** A cross-platform mobile app built with Expo and React Native, providing a seamless shopping experience for customers on iOS and Android.
*   **Documentation (`docs/`):** Comprehensive guides for deployment, environment configuration, and version control setup.

## Key Features

*   **Elegant Customer Interface:** A minimalist design focused on high-quality imagery and smooth navigation.
*   **Full Administrative Control:** A dedicated dashboard for managing products, categories, customer orders, and brand identity.
*   **Mobile-First Shopping:** Optimized mobile experience featuring product galleries and direct WhatsApp integration for customer support.
*   **Scalable Infrastructure:** Pre-configured for deployment on industry-standard platforms like Render, Vercel, and Expo Application Services (EAS).
